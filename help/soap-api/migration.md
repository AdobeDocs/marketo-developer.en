# Migrating to REST API

The Marketo Engage SOAP API will be retired after October 31, 2025. All existing integrations using the SOAP API should be retired or migrated to the [Marketo Engage REST API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/rest-api) by this date in order to avoid interruptions in service.

## Migration

The SOAP API supports a limited range of use cases compared to the [REST AP](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/rest-api)I. When determining which endpoints to map your use cases, you should follow [Marketo Integration Best Practices](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/marketo-integration-best-practices)

[Reference Architectures](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/reference-architectures) are available for [CRM Synchronization](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/marketo-developer/assets/sync-architecture-whitepaper.pdf?lang=en) and [Data Warehouse Export](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/marketo-developer/assets/reference_architecture.pdf?lang=en) use cases.

## Authentication

[Authentication Documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/authentication)

The Marketo REST API uses OAuth 2.0 based authentication with the Client Credentials grant type. Access tokens are valid for one hour after creation.

## Leads

[Lead API Documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/lead-database/leads)

The SOAP API supports lead data synchronization, [Munchkin cookie association](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/javascriptapi/leadtracking/lead-tracking), and lead merging. If your application calls the SOAP syncLead method and sets the `marketoCookie` parameter, you can migrate by either:

1. Using the [Sync Leads](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/mapi/#operation/syncLeadUsingPOST) REST method, followed by [Associated Lead](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/mapi/#operation/associateLeadUsingPOST)
2. You can call [Submit Form](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/lead-database/leads"%20\l%20"submit-form), though this requires configuration of some Marketing Assets and some interaction with the [Forms API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/assets/forms)

Applications which use the `foreignSysPersonId` key type, should migrate to using a custom lead field to represent this external identifier, and use either [Sync Leads](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/lead-database/leads#create-and-update) or [Bulk Lead Import](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo-developer/marketo/rest/bulk-import/bulk-lead-import) REST Methods.
