# Bulk Program Member Import

[Bulk Program Member Import Endpoint Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/mapi/#tag/Bulk-Import-Program-Members)

For large amounts of program member records, program members can be imported asynchronously with the [bulk API](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/mapi/#tag/Bulk-Import-Program-Members). This allows you to import a list of records into Marketo using a flat file with the delimiters (comma, tab, or semi-colon). The file can contain any number of records, so long as the file totals less than 10MB in size. The record operation is "insert or update" only.

## Processing Limits

You are allowed to submit more than one bulk import request, with limitations. Each request is added as a job to a FIFO queue to be processed. A maximum of two jobs are processed at the same time. A maximum of ten jobs are allowed in the queue at any given time (including the 2 currently being processed). If you exceed the ten job maximum, then a "1016, Too many imports" error is returned.

## Import File

The first row of the file must be a header which lists the corresponding REST API names as fields to map the values of each row into. REST API names can be retrieved using [Describe Lead](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/mapi/#tag/Leads/operation/describeUsingGET_2) and/or [Describe Program Member](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/mapi/#tag/Leads/operation/describeProgramMemberUsingGET) endpoints. Records can contain lead fields, custom lead fields, and custom program member fields.

A typical file would follow this basic pattern:

```
email,firstName,lastName
test@example.com,John,Doe
```

The call itself is made using the multipart/form-data content-type.

This request type can be difficult to implement, so it is highly recommended that you use an existing library implementation.

## Creating a Job

The [Import Program Members](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/mapi/#tag/Bulk-Import-Program-Members/operation/importProgramMemberUsingPOST) endpoint reads a file containing program member records and adds them to a program with a given status. The records can contain both lead fields and program member custom fields. All records must include the email field, which is used for deduplication purposes.

The `programId` path parameter specifies the program to which the members are added.

There are three required query parameters. The `format` parameter specifies the import file format (CSV, TSV, or SSV), the `programMemberStatus` parameter specifies the program status for the members that are being added to the program, and the `file` parameter contains the name of the import file that contains program member records.

```
POST /bulk/v1/program/{programId}/members/import.json?format=csv&programMemberStatus=On List
```

```

```json
{
    "requestId": "17f4a#16f87f87325",
    "result": [
        {
            "batchId": 1040,
            "importId": "1040",
            "status": "Queued"
        }
    ],
    "success": true
}
```

Notice in the response to our call that there is a `batchId` and a `status` field for the record in the result array. Since this endpoint is asynchronous, it can return a status of Queued, Importing, or Failed. You must retain the `batchId` to get the status of the import job, and to retrieve failures and/or warnings upon completion. The `batchId` remains valid for seven days.

Using the example above, a simple way to call the endpoint is to use cURL from the command line:

```bash
curl -i -F format='csv' -F programMemberStatus='On List' -F file='@Lead-House-Lannister.csv' -F access_token='<Access Token>' <REST API Endpoint Base URL>/bulk/v1/program/{programId}/members/import.json
```

Where the import file "Lead-House-Lannister.csv" contains the following:

```
firstName,lastName,email,title,company,leadScore
Joanna,Lannister,Joanna@Lannister.com,Lannister,House Lannister,0
Tywin,Lannister,Tywin@Lannister.com,Lannister,House Lannister,0
Cersei,Lannister,Cersei@Lannister.com,Lannister,House Lannister,0
Jamie,Lannister,Jamie@Lannister.com,Lannister,House Lannister,0
Tyrion,Lannister,Tyrion@Lannister.com,Lannister,House Lannister,0
Kevan,Lannister,Kevan@Lannister.com,Lannister,House Lannister,0
Dorna,Lannister,Dorna@Lannister.com,Lannister,House Lannister,0
Lancel,Lannister,Lancel@Lannister.com,Lannister,House Lannister,0
```

## Polling Job Status

Once the import job has been created, you must query its status. It is best practice to poll the import job every 5-30 seconds. Do this by passing the `batchId` path parameter to the [Get Import Program Member Status](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/mapi/#tag/Bulk-Import-Program-Members/operation/getImportProgramMemberStatusUsingGET) endpoint.

```
GET /bulk/v1/program/members/import/{batchId}/status.json
```

```json
{
    "requestId": "e0cb#16f87f8b177",
    "result": [
        {
            "batchId": 1040,
            "importId": "1040",
            "status": "Complete",
            "numOfLeadsProcessed": 8,
            "numOfRowsFailed": 0,
            "numOfRowsWithWarning": 0,
            "message": "Import succeeded, 8 records imported (8 members)"
        }
    ],
    "success": true
}
```

This response shows a completed import. The status can be one of: Complete, Queued, Importing, Failed.

If the job has completed, you have a listing of the number of rows processed, failed, or with warnings. The message parameter may also give the failure message if status is Failed.

## Failures

Failures are indicated by the `numOfRowsFailed` attribute in [Get Import Program Member Status](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/mapi/#tag/Bulk-Import-Program-Members/operation/getImportProgramMemberStatusUsingGET) response. If numOfRowsFailed is greater than zero, then that value indicates the number of failures that occurred.

Use the [Get Import Program Member Failures](http://TODO) endpoint to retrieve records and causes of failed rows by passing the `batchId` path parameter.

```
GET /bulk/v1/program/members/import/{batchId}/failures.json
```

The endpoint responds with a file indicating which rows failed, along with a message indicating why the record failed. The format of the file is the same as specified in `format` parameter during job creation. An additional field is appended to each record with a description of the failure.

For example, suppose that you import the following file with an invalid lead score:

```
firstName,lastName,email,title,company,leadScore
Aerys,Targaryen,Aerys@Targaryen.com,Targaryen,House Targaryen,TEXT_VALUE_IN_INTEGER_FIELD
```

When you check the job status, you see `numOfRowsFailed` is 1 which indicates that a failure occurred:

```
GET /bulk/v1/program/members/import/{batchId}/status.json
```

```json
{
    "requestId": "4c2d#16f8b32c8ef",
    "result": [
        {
            "batchId": 1046,
            "importId": "1046",
            "status": "Complete",
            "numOfLeadsProcessed": 0,
            "numOfRowsFailed": 1,
            "numOfRowsWithWarning": 0,
            "message": "Import completed with errors, 0 records imported (0 members), 1 failed"
        }
    ],
    "success": true
}
```

You then retrieve the failures file for additional details about the failure:

```
GET /bulk/v1/program/members/import/{batchId}/failures.json
```

```
firstName,lastName,email,title,company,leadScore,Import Failure Reason
Aerys,Targaryen,Aerys@Targaryen.com,Targaryen,House Targaryen,TEXT_VALUE_IN_INTEGER_FIELD,Invalid data type in field Lead Score
```

## Warnings

Warnings are indicated by the `numOfRowsWithWarning` attribute in [Get Import Program Member Status](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/mapi/#tag/Bulk-Import-Program-Members/operation/getImportProgramMemberStatusUsingGET) response. If numOfRowsWithWarning is greater than zero, then that value indicates the number of warnings that occurred.

Use the [Get Import Program Member Warnings](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/mapi/#tag/Bulk-Import-Program-Members/operation/getImportProgramMemberWarningsUsingGET) endpoint to retrieve records and causes of warning rows by passing the `batchId` path parameter.

```
GET /bulk/v1/program/members/import/{batchId}/warnings.json
```

The endpoint responds with a file indicating which rows produced warnings, along with a message indicating why the record produced a warning. The format of the file is the same as specified in `format` parameter during job creation. An additional field is appended to each record with a description of the warning.

For example, suppose that you import the following file with an invalid email address:

```
firstName,lastName,email,title,company,leadScore
Aerys,Targaryen,INVALID_EMAIL,Targaryen,House Targaryen,0
```

When you check the job status, you see numOfRowsWithWarning is 1 which indicates that a warning occurred:

```
GET /bulk/v1/program/members/import/{batchId}/status.json
```

```json
{
   "requestId":"4ca1#16f883c2003",
   "result":[
      {
         "batchId":1041,
         "importId":"1041",
         "status":"Complete",
         "numOfLeadsProcessed":1,
         "numOfRowsFailed":0,
         "numOfRowsWithWarning":1,
         "message":"Import succeeded, 1 records imported (1 members), 1 warning."
      }
   ],
   "success":true
}
```

You then retrieve the warnings file for additional details about the warning:

```
GET /bulk/v1/program/members/import/{batchId}/warnings.json
```

```
firstName,lastName,email,title,company,leadScore,Import Warning Reason
Aerys,Targaryen,INVALID_EMAIL,Targaryen,House Targaryen,0,Invalid email address
```
