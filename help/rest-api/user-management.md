# User Management

[User Management Endpoint Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/user/)

Marketo provides a set of User Management endpoints allow you to perform CRUD operations on user records in Marketo. Users are created by sending an invitation to a user, who then sets a password and gains access to Marketo for the first time.

Unlike other Marketo REST APIs, when using the User Management APIs:

- You must use the HTTP header method to send the access token to authenticate. You cannot pass access token as a query string parameter. More information on authentication is [here](authentication.md).
- You must select a role permission from two different groups when creating the user role for [Custom Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/additional-integrations/create-a-custom-service-for-use-with-rest-api) for REST API: 
  1. "Access Users" permission from the [Access Admin](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/users-and-roles/descriptions-of-role-permissions) group 
  1. "Access User Management Api" from the [Access API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/users-and-roles/descriptions-of-role-permissions) group
- Response bodies do not contain the "success" boolean attribute indicating success or failure of a call. Instead you must evaluate the HTTP response status code. If a call succeeds, a 200 status code is returned. If a call fails, a non-200 level status code is returned and the response body contains the standard "errors" array with error code and descriptive error message.
- The format of datetime strings is "yyyyMMdd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS't'+|-hhmm". This applies to the following attributes: createdAt, updatedAt, expiresAt.
- User Management API endpoints are not prefixed with "/rest" like other endpoints.

## Query

Query support for user management includes ability to retrieve all users, roles, and workspaces. Also, you can retrieve a single user record by user id, or role/wordspace record by user id.

```
GET /userservice/management/v1/users/{userid}/user.json
```

```json
{
  "userid": "jamie@houselannister.com",
  "firstName": "Jamie",

## Invite User

On [Adobe IMS-integrated subscriptions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/marketo-with-adobe-identity/adobe-identity-management-overview), this endpoint supports invitation of [API-Only Users](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/users-and-roles/create-an-api-only-user) only. To invite [standard Users](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/users-and-roles/managing-marketo-users), use the [Adobe User Management API](https://developer.adobe.com/umapi/) instead.

The [Invite User](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/user/#tag/User-Management/operation/inviteUserUsingPOST) endpoint to send a "Welcome to Marketo" email invitation to new user. The email body contains a "Login to Marketo" link which allows user to access Marketo for the first time. To accept the invitation, the email recipient clicks the "Login to Marketo" link, creates their password, and gains access to Marketo. Until the acceptance process is complete, the invitation is "pending" and the user record may not be edited. A pending invitation expires seven days after being sent. More information about managing users can be found [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/users-and-roles/managing-marketo-users).

Parameters are passed in the request body in application/json format .

The following parameters are required:  `emailAddress`, `firstName`, `lastName, userRoleWorkspaces`. The `userRoleWorkspaces` parameter is an array of objects which contain `accessRoleId` and `workspaceId` attributes.

The `userid` parameter is a unique user identifier string value used for user login purposes and must be formatted as an email address. If not provided in the request, the value of `userid` defaults to the value provided in `emailAddress` parameter.

The boolean `apiOnly` parameter specifies whether the user is an [API-Only user](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/users-and-roles/create-an-api-only-user). The `expiresAt` parameter specifies when user login expires and is formatted using W3C ISO-8601 format (without milliseconds). If not provided in request, the user never expires. The `reason` parameter is a string that describes the reason for the user invitation.

The endpoint returns a value of "true" if successful, otherwise an error message is returned.

```
POST /userservice/management/v1/users/invite.json
```

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "emailAddress": "daenerys@housetargaryen.com",
  "firstName": "Daenerys",
  "lastName": "Targaryen",
  "expiresAt": "2020-12-31T23:59:59-05:00",
  "reason": "Keeper of dragons",
  "userRoleWorkspaces": [
    {
      "accessRoleId": 1,
      "workspaceId": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

```
true
```

Below is an example of the "Welcome to Marketo" email invitation that is sent to the new user. The email subject line is "Marketo Login Information", the sender is the email address of the API-Only User associated with the [REST API Custom Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/additional-integrations/create-a-custom-service-for-use-with-rest-api), and the recipient is as specified via the firstName, lastName, and emailAddress parameters.

![Invite User Email](assets/invite-user-email.png)

The user accepts the email invitation by entering her password twice and clicking "CREATE PASSWORD" button. She then is granted access to Marketo for the first time.
