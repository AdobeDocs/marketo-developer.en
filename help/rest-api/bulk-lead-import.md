# Bulk Lead Import

[Bulk Lead Import Endpoint Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/mapi/#tag/Bulk-Import-Leads)

For large amounts of lead records, leads can be imported asynchronously with the [bulk API](https://developer.adobe.com/marketo-apis/api/mapi/#tag/Bulk-Import-Leads/operation/importLeadUsingPOST). This allows you to import a list of records into Marketo using a flat file with the delimiters (comma, tab, or semi-colon). The file can contain any number of records, so long as the file totals less than 10MB in size. The record operation is "insert or update" only.

## Processing Limits

You are allowed to submit more than one bulk import request, with limitations. Each request is added as a job to a FIFO queue to be processed. A maximum of two jobs are processed at the same time. A maximum of ten jobs are allowed in the queue at any given time (including the 2 currently being processed). If you exceed the ten job maximum, then a "1016, Too many imports" error is returned.

## Import File

The first row of the file must be a header which lists the corresponding REST API fields to map the values of each row into. A typical file would follow this basic pattern:

```
email,firstName,lastName
test@example.com,John,Doe
```

The `externalCompanyId` field may be used to link the lead record to a company record. The `externalSalesPersonId`Â field may be used to link the lead record to a sales person record.

The call itself is made using the `multipart/form-data` content-type.

This request type can be difficult to implement, so it is highly recommended that you use an existing library implementation.

## Creating a Job

To make a bulk import request, you must set your content-type header to "multipart/form-data" and include at least a file parameter with your file content, and a format parameter with the value "csv", "tsv", or "ssv" denoting your file format.

```
POST /bulk/v1/leads.json?format=csv
```

```
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=------WebKitFormBoundaryBQACkJZyaiIAXogC
Content-Length: 311
Host: <munchkinId>.mktorest.com
```

```
------WebKitFormBoundaryBQACkJZyaiIAXogC
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="leads.csv"
Content-Type: text/csv

FirstName,LastName,Email,Company
Able,Baker,ablebaker@marketo.com,Marketo
Charlie,Dog,charliedog@marketo.com,Marketo
Easy,Fox,easyfox@marketo.com,Marketo
------WebKitFormBoundaryBQACkJZyaiIAXogC--
```

```json
{
    "requestId": "d01f#15d672f8560",
    "result": [
        {
            "batchId": 3404,
            "importId": "3404",
            "status": "Queued"
        }
    ],
    "success": true
}
```

This endpoint uses [multipart/form-data as the content-type](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html). This can be tricky to get right, so best practice is to use an HTTP support library for your language of choice. A simple way to do this with cURL from the command line looks like this:

```
curl -i -F format=csv -F file=@lead_data.csv -F access_token=<Access Token> <REST API Endpoint Base URL>/bulk/v1/leads.json
```

Where the import file "lead_data.csv" contains the following:

```
FirstName,LastName,Email,Company
Able,Baker,ablebaker@marketo.com,Marketo
Charlie,Dog,charliedog@marketo.com,Marketo
Easy,Fox,easyfox@marketo.com,Marketo
```

You can also optionally include the `lookupField`, `listId`, and `partitionName` parameters in your request. `lookupField` allows you to select a specific field to deduplicate on, just like Sync Leads, and defaults to email. You can specify `id` as `lookupField` to indicate an "update only" operation. `listId` allows you to select a static list to import the list of leads to; this will cause the leads in the list to become members of this static list, in addition to any creations or updates caused by the import. `partitionName` selects a specific partition to import to. See the Workspaces and Partitions section for more information.

Notice in the response to our call, that there is not a listing of successes or failures like with Sync Leads, but a batchId and a status field for the record in the result array. This is because this API is asynchronous, and can return a status of Queued, Importing, or Failed. You must retain the batchId to get the status of the import job, and to retrieve failures and/or warnings upon completion. The batchId remains valid for seven days.

## Polling Job Status

It is best practice to poll the job every 5-30 seconds, depending on required latency and API call limitations, to see the status of the import job. You can do so with the Get Import Lead Status API.

```
GET /bulk/v1/leads/batch/{id}.json
```

```json
{
   "requestId":"8136#146daebc2ed",
   "success":true,
   "result":[
      {
         "batchId":1022,
         "status":"Complete",
         "numOfLeadsProcessed":2,
         "numOfRowsFailed":1,
         "numOfRowsWithWarning":0,
         "message":"Import completed with errors, 2 records imported (2 members), 1 failed"
      }
   ]
}

```

This response shows a completed import, but the status can be one of:

- Complete
- Queued
- Importing
- Failed

If the job has completed, you have a listing of the number of rows processed, failed, on ones with warnings. The message parameter may also give the failure message if status is Failed.

## Failures

Failures are indicated by the "numOfRowsFailed" attribute in Get Import Lead Status response. If "numOfRowsFailed" is greater than zero, then that value indicates the number of failures that occurred.

To retrieve the records and causes of failed rows, you'll must retrieve the failure file:

```
GET /bulk/v1/leads/batch/{id}/failures.json
```

The API responds with a file indicating which rows failed, along with a message indicating why the record failed. The format of the file is the same as specified in "format" parameter during job creation. An additional field is appended to each record with a description of the failure.

## Warnings

Warnings are indicated by the "numOfRowsWithWarning" attribute in Get Import Lead Status response. If "numOfRowsWithWarning" is greater than zero, then that value indicates the number of warnings that occurred.

To retrieve the records and causes of warning rows, retrieve the warning file:

```
GET /bulk/v1/leads/batch/{id}/warnings.json
```

The API responds with a file indicating which rows produced warnings, along with a message indicating why the record failed. The format of the file is the same as specified in "format" parameter during job creation. An additional field is appended to each record with a description of the warning.
