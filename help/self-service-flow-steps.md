# Self-service Flow Steps

Self-Service Flow Steps is a set of features allowing an integrator to deploy a web API that can be used as a Flow Step in Marketo Smart Campaigns. A Flow Step Service can receive lead and other related data, do any necessary processing, including invocation of other web services, and subsequently write lead and activity data into Marketo through a callback. The developer documentation can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/Marketo-SSFS-Service-Provider-Interface).
