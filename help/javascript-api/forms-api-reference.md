# Forms API Reference

There are two main objects that you will interact with using the Forms 2.0 API. The `MktoForms2` object and the `Form` object. The `MktoForms2` object is the top-level publicly visible namespace for Forms2 functionality and contains functions to create, load, and fetch Form objects.

      <td>.onValidate(callback)</td>
      <td>Adds a validation callback that will be called anytime validation is triggered.</td>
      <td>callback(Function) - A callback that will be triggered any time that validation occurs. The callback will be passed one parameter, a boolean stating if the validation had succeeded.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>.submit()</td>

      <td>n/a</td>
      <td>Form Object - The same form object on which the method was called, for chaining purposes.</td>

      <td>callback - A function that will be called when the form has been successfully submitted. This callback will be passed two arguments. A JS Object containing the values that were submitted and a String url of the follow up page that the user will be forwarded to, or null or empty string if there is no configured follow up page. Special behavior: If this callback returns `false` (measured using ===) then the visitor will NOT be forwarded to the follow up page and the page will NOT be reloaded. This allows the implementor to do extra processing to the follow up url, or to take action on page using JavaScript instead of leaving the page.</td>
      <td>Form Object - The same form object on which the method was called, for chaining purposes.</td>

      <td>canSubmit (optional)(Boolean) - Sets the form to be submittable or non submittable.</td>
      <td>Boolean or Form Object - If called with no arguments, returns a boolean indicating if the form is submittable. If called with one argument, returns this Form Object for chaining purposes. </td>
