# Get Visitor Data

This method is used to get real-time visitor identification data.

- You must become a Web Personalization customer and have the [RTP tag deployed](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/web-personalization/rtp-tag-implementation/deploy-the-rtp-javascript) on your site prior to using the User Context API.
- RTP does not support Account Based Marketing named account lists. ABM lists and code only pertain to the uploaded account lists (CSV files) managed within RTP.

If an error occurs, there will be an error message as part of the response JSON. If a 500 code is returned, contact support with the request you made.

| Parameter | Optional/Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get` | Required | String | Method action. |
| `visitor` | Required | String | Method name. |
| `callback` | Required | Function | Callback function to be triggered for each campaign returned. |

## Examples

Get visitor identification data:

```javascript
function callbackFunction() {
    console.log('RTP is awesome!');
}
rtp('get', 'visitor', callbackFunction);
