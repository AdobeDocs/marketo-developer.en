Marketo Mobile Engagement enables marketers to listen and respond to customers on their mobile devices to easily deliver compelling mobile experiences.

Marketo Mobile Engagement is made up of two components:

1. Mobile SDK

    The Marketo Mobile SDK is integrated into your mobile application and is the engine responsible for delivering powerful marketing, and for gathering analytics.

1. Mobile Marketing

    Marketers use Marketo to define audiences, create notifications, launch targeted messaging campaigns, and view detailed customer analytics.

After you integrate the Marketo SDK into your mobile application, you will be able to send both Mobile Push Notifications, and In-App Messages to your customers from Marketo. To find out how to setup and deploy mobile messaging within Marketo, see the [Mobile Marketing](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/mobile-marketing/admin/add-a-mobile-app) section in our product documentation.
